Overview

The Transport Management Program organizes transportation logistics for events. After successful user authentication, the main page displays a list of existing events and a button to create a new event. Creating an event involves a multi-step modal window where users input event details, fleet markers, hotel names, and destinations. After creating an event, users can select an event from the list to access a dashboard page specific to that event, which provides links to manage the event’s components: Flight Schedule, Transport Report, and RealTimeStatus. All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, linked by event_id.
Main Page

    Display:
        A list of event names (name from the events table) fetched from the database.
        A button labeled "Create New Event" that opens a modal for event creation.
    Functionality:
        Clicking an event name redirects to the event’s dashboard page (e.g., /dashboard/:eventId).
        Authentication is assumed to be handled (e.g., via JWT or session); users see only events they’re associated with (via event_users).

Event Creation Modal

A multi-step wizard in a modal window collects:

    Step 1: Event Details
        Fields:
            Name: Text input (required, e.g., "Conference 2025").
            Start Date: Date input (required, e.g., 20-7-2025).
            End Date: Date input (required, e.g., 30-7-2025).
            Description: Textarea (optional).
        Button: "Next" to proceed.
    Step 2: Fleet Markers
        Field: Text input for fleet markers (e.g., Car-001, Bus-ABC).
        Functionality: Users can add unlimited markers by clicking "Add" or pressing Enter, with the list displayed dynamically.
        Button: "Next" to proceed.
    Step 3: Hotel Names
        Field: Text input for hotel names (e.g., Hilton Hotel, Marriott Hotel).
        Functionality: Users can add unlimited hotel names similarly.
        Button: "Next" to proceed.
    Step 4: Destinations
        Field: Text input for destinations (e.g., Conference Center, Airport).
        Functionality: Users can add unlimited destinations similarly.
        Button: "Create" to finalize, log data to console.log, save to the database, and close the modal.

Dashboard Page

    Display:
        Event name and details (e.g., Conference 2025, 20-7-2025 to 30-7-2025).
        Links/buttons to manage:
            Flight Schedule: Upload and manage flight data from Excel files.
            Transport Report: Submit and view worker reports.
            RealTimeStatus: Manage dynamic transport data (vehicle codes, hotels, destinations, guests).
    Functionality:
        All data displayed is filtered by the selected event_id.
        Links navigate to respective module pages or trigger actions (e.g., file upload for Flight Schedule).

Data Flow

    After authentication, users see the main page with events they’re authorized to access (via event_users).
    Creating an event via the modal populates events, flet, hotel, and destination tables.
    Selecting an event redirects to /dashboard/:eventId, where users access module-specific functionality.
    Flight Schedule data is uploaded via Excel and stored in flight_schedule.
    Transport Report and RealTimeStatus data are managed via forms or interfaces in their respective modules.

    You are an expert developer in HTML and CSS, focusing on best practices, accessibility, and responsive design.

    Key Principles
    - Write semantic HTML to improve accessibility and SEO.
    - Use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles.
    - Ensure responsive design using media queries and flexible layouts.
    - Prioritize accessibility by using ARIA roles and attributes.

    HTML
    - Use semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <section>).
    - Use <button> for clickable elements, not <div> or <span>.
    - Use <a> for links, ensuring href attribute is present.
    - Use <img> with alt attribute for images.
    - Use <form> for forms, with appropriate input types and labels.
    - Avoid using deprecated elements (e.g., <font>, <center>).

    CSS
    - Use external stylesheets for CSS.
    - Use class selectors over ID selectors for styling.
    - Use Flexbox and Grid for layout.
    - Use rem and em units for scalable and accessible typography.
    - Use CSS variables for consistent theming.
    - Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming classes.
    - Avoid !important; use specificity to manage styles.

    Responsive Design
    - Use media queries to create responsive layouts.
    - Use mobile-first approach for media queries.
    - Ensure touch targets are large enough for touch devices.
    - Use responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes.
    - Use viewport meta tag for responsive scaling.

    Accessibility
    - Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility.
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text.
    - Provide keyboard navigation for interactive elements.
    - Use focus styles to indicate focus state.
    - Use landmarks (e.g., <nav>, <main>, <aside>) for screen readers.

    Performance
    - Minimize CSS and HTML file sizes.
    - Use CSS minification and compression.
    - Avoid excessive use of animations and transitions.
    - Use lazy loading for images and other media.

    Testing
    - Test HTML and CSS in multiple browsers and devices.
    - Use tools like Lighthouse for performance and accessibility audits.
    - Validate HTML and CSS using W3C validators.

    Documentation
    - Comment complex CSS rules and HTML structures.
    - Use consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs.
    - Document responsive breakpoints and design decisions.

    Refer to MDN Web Docs for HTML and CSS best practices and to the W3C guidelines for accessibility standards.

## Responsive Container Standard (2024)

- All main content must be wrapped in the shared `Container` component (`src/components/layout/Container.tsx`).
- The Container applies:
  - `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 w-full` for responsive, consistent sizing and padding.
  - Mobile-first layout, scaling up to desktop.
- Do not use custom paddings/margins for page-level contentâ€”use the Container instead.
- This ensures:
  - Consistent, professional appearance
  - Proper alignment and spacing on all devices
  - Simplified responsive design
- See UI documentation for usage examples.
